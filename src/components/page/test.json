The theory is formulated\nfor low temperatures when heat transport is limited by electron scattering from\nrandom defects and for superconductors with nodes in the order parameter. We\nshow that certain eigenvalues of the thermal conductivity tensor are universal\nat low temperature, $k_B T\\ll \\gamma$, where $\\gamma$ is the bandwidth of\nimpurity bound states in the superconducting phase. The components of the\nelectrical and thermal conductivity also obey a Wiedemann-Franz law with the\nLorenz ratio, $L(T)=\\kappa/\\sigma T$, given by the Sommerfeld value of\n$L_{\\!S}=({\\pi^2}/{3})(k_B/e)^2$ for $k_BT\\ll\\gamma$. For intermediate\ntemperatures the Lorenz ratio deviates significantly from $L_{\\!S}$, and is\nstrongly dependent on the scattering cross section, and qualitatively different\nfor resonant vs.\\ nonresonant scattering.

The radiative shock wave models with electron\nthermal conduction in the vicinity of the viscous jump are compared with pure\nradiative models. The threshold shock wave velocity above of which effects of\nelectron thermal conduction become perceptible is of U1=70 km/s and corresponds\nto the upstream Mach numbers from M1= 6 at T1=8000K to M1=11 at T1=3000K. In\nshocks with efficient electron heat conduction more than a half of hydrogen\natoms are ionized in the radiative precursor, whereas behind the viscous jump\nthe hydrogen gas undergoes the full ionization. The existence of the electron\nconductive precursor leads to the enhancement of the Lyman continuum flux\ntrapped in the surroundings of the discontinuous jump. For upstream velocities\nranged within 70 km/s <= U1 <= 85 km/s the partially ionized hydrogen gas of\nthe radiative precursor undergoes the additional ionization (<= 5%), whereas\nthe total radiave flux emerging from the shock wave increases by 10% <=\ndelta(FRad) <= 25% .\n", "category": "astro-ph/", "doiLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20020995", "paperLink": "http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0206240v1", "pdfLink": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0206240v1"}, {"author": "Hiroaki Kusunose/T.

We\npresent two methods for calculating kappa, a quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) method\nand a method where the phonons but not the electrons are treated\nsemiclassically (SC). We compare the two methods for a model of alkali-doped\nC60, A3C60, and show that they agree well. We then mainly use the SC method,\nwhich is simpler and easier to interpret. We perform SC calculations for Nb for\nlarge temperatures T and find that kappa increases with T as kappa(T)=a+bT,\nwhere a and b are constants, consistent with a saturation of the mean free\npath, l, and in good agreement with experiment. In contrast, we find that for\nA3C60, kappa(T) decreases with T for very large T. We discuss the reason for\nthis qualitatively in the limit of large T. We give a quantum-mechanical\nexplanation of the saturation of l for Nb and derive the Wiedemann-Franz law in\nthe limit of T much smaller than W, where W is the band width. In contrast, due\nto the small W of A3C60, the assumption T much smaller than W can be violated.\nWe show that this leads to kappa(T) \\sim T^{-3/2} for very large T and a strong\nviolation of the Wiedemann-Franz law.\n", "category": "cond-mat.mtrl-sci/", "doiLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.74.235116", "paperLink": "http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0607634v1", "pdfLink": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0607634v1"}, {"author": "P.

Traditionally, when\nderiving the phonon mediated thermal conductivity $\\kappa_{ph} = \\kappa -\n\\kappa_{el}$ from the measured total thermal conductivity $\\kappa$ the constant\nLorenz number $L_0$ of the Wiedemann-Franz law \\mbox{$\\mathbf{\\kappa_{el}}=T\nL_0 \\sigma$} is chosen. The present study demonstrates that this procedure is\nnot reliable when the Seebeck coefficient $|S|$ becomes large which is exactly\nthe case for a thermoelectric material of interest. Another approximation using\n$L_0-S^2$, which seem to work better for medium values of $S^2$ also fails when\n$S^2$ becomes large, as is the case when the system becomes\nsemiconducting/insulating. For a reliable estimation of $\\kappa_{el}$ it is\nproposed, that a full first-principles calculations by combining density\nfunctional theory with Boltzmann's transport theory has to be made.
